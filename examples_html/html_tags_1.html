    <h1>Welcome Human</h1>
    <p>
        This is a website.<br>
        It is not impressive.
    </p>

        It has text.<br>
        It has structure.<br>
        That is enough for now.

        Design comes later.<br>
        Animation comes later.<br>
        Making it pretty is tomorrow's problem.
